# Initial Concept

## Target Audience
- DIY Hobbyists and Makers
- Smart Home Enthusiasts (implied)

## Project Goal
- Provide a clear, low-power weather dashboard on a 4.2" E-Paper display.

## Core Features
- **Compact Weather UI:** Optimize the display to use less space for weather information.
- **Rain Probability:** Display the likelihood of precipitation.
- **Afterschool Schedule:** Display children's afterschool schedules, fetched from a simple online storage source (TBD).
- **Existing Functionality:** Maintain OpenWeatherMap integration (adapted for the new UI).

## Hardware Context
- **Display:** 4.2" E-Paper Display (Note: Previous documentation referenced a 5.79" screen; this project specifically targets the 4.2" version).
- **Platform:** ESP32 (as per existing code).
