- **Existing Functionality:** Maintain OpenWeatherMap integration (adapted for the new UI).

## Hardware Context
- **Display:** 4.2" E-Paper Display (Note: Previous documentation referenced a 5.79" screen; this project specifically targets the 4.2" version).
- **Platform:** ESP32 (as per existing code).
